WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
All right. So hopefully, you've had a chance to think of a few ideas as well.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.805
We've got a bunch here.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.630
And what we're gonna do is we're actually just gonna put up our ideas.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.265
This will be our work space here.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.350
We're gonna put up our ideas.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.070
[NOISE] And what we wanna do- oh, perfect, strength coach, good.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.130
What we wanna do is choose a location that's authentic to us.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.755
We mentioned in the flow of steps for,

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:27.780
how to seek out analogous exploration,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.360
it's important to go visit a location

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.315
and actually submit to the experience, patronize it.

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:36.640
We're not going to any of these- we're not going to a midwife and asking her,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.220
"How do you build trust quickly?"

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.380
We're going to met- midwife and we'd have say,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.145
I mean, this has to be true, right,

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.690
"We're expecting a child and we wanna know what it's like to have

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.405
alternative birthing experiences" or something like that, right?

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:52.010
So you- so the- the primary consideration for which place we should

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.110
visit is which place could we be an authentic customer of?

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.275
Because we want to go immerse ourselves in the experience,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:04.215
not just go and ask one of these people for advice about how to solve our problem.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.575
None of them know how to make a car dealership,

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:08.105
a more trusting experience.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.100
All of them know how to make, uh,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.669
their experiences and themselves credible and trustworthy,

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:17.405
and it's our job to set ourselves up to learn how they do that.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.090
And the very best way to set ourselves up for success

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.120
is to authentically feel the need ourselves.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.315
So Perry, as we look at this list,

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:26.945
is there anything that jumps out to you?

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:28.700
My kids are kinda not in preschool a-,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.050
I don't want a tattoo.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.540
Uh, you know, what's interesting is I do- I, um,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.100
dropped my sunglasses on the ground the other day and they've got two huge-

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.270
Yeah.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910
-scratches on them. And I noticed, uh,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.250
even as I was driving, I'd have to like avoid the scratch. [LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.415
Yeah.

00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:42.900
Just because it's. So- so [OVERLAPPING]

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.630
Would that be a place you'd build trust with somebody

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.745
probably if you're making a considered purchase.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.575
You know, what's funny [OVERLAPPING] actually is,

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.640
there's a guy, um,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.200
there's a- there's a place in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.570
downtown Palo Alto nearby where [OVERLAPPING] I used to live.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.385
Before I got LASIK surgery,

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:57.695
I am- I used to get glasses there.

00:01:57.695 --> 00:01:59.900
And one thing that was interesting is he, uh,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.590
he helped me figure out what glasses are good for my face.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.210
And I wonder if he could do the same thing for sunglasses.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.345
I've never, um, I don't even know if my sunglasses are good.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:12.020
You know, if they're- if they're good sunglasses or if they're not.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.060
But to me, this is- uh, if I had to say-

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.560
Yeah. So you've got it- you've actually have a broken-

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.730
This is authentic to me because, yeah,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.410
I recently damaged my sunglasses,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.310
I'm looking to either repair them or replace them.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.070
I don't know if I should just get new lenses or whether I should get new frames entirely.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.755
Okay.

00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:34.740
And I'll introduce myself by emphasizing, um, I would say,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.110
the fact that I don't know what the- what the right,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.450
"right glasses" are for my face,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.215
or for my style, whatever it is.

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:42.740
Okay.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.340
I don't want the [OVERLAPPING]

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.585
I'm just literally writing that out,

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:50.190
I don't know. Okay.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.535
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to head into the field.

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:58.000
We're gonna go visit the optometrist-

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.160
Yeah.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.580
-right now. And we're gonna go immerse ourselves in this experience.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.880
And what we wanna do is we wanna invite you along with us to come and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.540
see how this optometrist builds trust quickly.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.835
[NOISE] So you can see [NOISE] from the- from the worksheet,

00:03:11.835 --> 00:03:14.850
our goal is to- is to learn about how to build trust quickly.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.035
So we're gonna go to the optometrist.

00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:19.820
It's authentic to me because I actually did just recently

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.105
damage my sunglasses and need to get them repaired or replaced.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:25.880
And I'm gonna introduce myself emphasizing,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.990
I don't know which looks good on me because that sets the optometrist up

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.550
to have to do whatever he has to do to get me to believe that his,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.400
uh, his proposed course of action is correct.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.530
And ultimately, what we're trying to figure out how to do is,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.700
how do we build trust quickly?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.980
Yeah.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.845
So we're gonna immerse ourselves in this experience.

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:45.080
And I'll go along as Jeremy's do-

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.675
we talked about the role of duos,

00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:48.180
and simply take notes.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.560
I'll- I don't want to be part of the experience.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.870
I'm gonna hang back hopefully as- as far as I can so I don't affect it,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.270
but just simply take notes on what I notice is happening that

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.810
might be aspects of how trust is being built between the two of you,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.055
and then we'll compare afterwards.

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:04.250
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna head out of the studio now. You'll come with us.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.530
And what we'd ask you to do is write down

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.060
three or four very specific observations or quotes-.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.290
Yeah.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.870
-or moments that you feel that the optometrist creates,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.920
as- I hope he will.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.890
I'm sure he will build a sense of trust with me as

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.995
I submit myself to his experience. Let's go.

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:24.400
Great.
